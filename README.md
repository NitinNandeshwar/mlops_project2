Heart Failure Prediction



In a typical **Machine Learning (ML) pipeline**, each of these steps plays a critical role in preparing data, building the model, and deploying it. Here’s a brief explanation of each file/module and the sub-steps usually involved:

---

### 1. **`data_ingestion.py`**

This module is responsible for **gathering raw data** from various sources and making it ready for processing.

**Sub-steps:**

* Connecting to data sources (e.g., databases, APIs, files, cloud storage)
* Downloading/extracting the data
* Handling data versioning
* Initial schema validation
* Storing the raw data in a data lake or staging area

---

### 2. **`data_preprocessing.py`**

Cleans and transforms the raw data into a usable format.

**Sub-steps:**

* Handling missing values
* Data type conversion
* Removing duplicates
* Basic normalization or scaling
* Outlier detection and handling
* Encoding categorical variables

---

### 3. **`feature_engineering.py`**

Transforms preprocessed data into meaningful features for the model.

**Sub-steps:**

* Creating new features (e.g., date to day/month/year)
* Polynomial or interaction features
* Aggregation (rolling means, grouped stats)
* Dimensionality reduction (PCA, feature selection)
* Feature scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)

---

### 4. **`model_building.py`**

Trains machine learning models using the engineered features.

**Sub-steps:**

* Splitting data into train/validation/test sets
* Selecting ML algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
* Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearch, RandomSearch, or Optuna)
* Cross-validation
* Saving trained models

---

### 5. **`model_evaluation.py`**

Evaluates the model’s performance on unseen data.

**Sub-steps:**

* Calculating metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC, etc.)
* Generating confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.
* Comparing multiple models
* Checking for overfitting/underfitting
* Model interpretability (e.g., SHAP, LIME)

---

### 6. **`register_model.py`**

Handles model registration and version control, often for deployment purposes.

**Sub-steps:**

* Registering the trained model in a model registry (like MLflow, Azure ML, SageMaker)
* Storing model metadata (version, metrics, parameters, date)
* Tagging the model for production, staging, or development
* Optional: uploading to model storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)

If you're building an end-to-end ML system, all these scripts/modules are usually orchestrated in a pipeline using tools like **Airflow, Kubeflow, or MLflow Pipelines**.
